"Buen Equipo, Funciona Bien",4.0 out of 5 stars,"El envío fue rápido, y el equipo llego en buenas condiciones y funcionando perfectamente.Nota: Si tienes una línea telefónica de código +1  o no requieres crear una nueva cuenta de Amazon para enlazar la tablet, es muy seguro que la información siguiente no te interese.El motivo por el cual no le doy cinco estrellas es por la parte del registro del equipo. Para acceder a la tablet necesitas tener una cuenta de Amazon. Había comprado 2 equipos, uno para mí y otro era para otra persona. Al momento de querer configurar la tablet de la otra persona, este no tenía cuenta de Amazon, así que decidí crear una  cuenta. No obstante, se me hizo muy engorroso debido a que esta vez para la creación de la cuenta me pedía verificar la nueva cuenta con un correo o número telefónico. Colocaba el correo, me llegaba el código de verificación al correo, verificaba y luego me pedía validar un número telefónico. No obstante, nunca me llegaba el código de verificación al número telefónico. Cabe destacar que soy de Venezuela por lo que mi código es +58.Posteriormente, contacte a soporte para ver porque no me llegaba el código de verificación a mi número telefónico. Ellos alegaban que se podía registrar la cuenta con solo el correo, pero en mi caso me pedía verificar correo y número telefónico. Al final,  después de tratar con varias cosas que me habían sugerido, tuve que registrar la cuenta con un número telefónico de estados unidos +1, y fue así que pude crear la cuenta para la otra tablet."
Great Affordable Wi-Fi Tablet,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I had an older Fire 7, and it didn’t have any memory or slots for memory cards. It had its limitations with using Amazon Apps from the App Store. For a first time tablet I guess it was ok, it was a learning curve because it was different than a laptop.I saw to new Fire 10 this year on sale and thought I’d give it a try. It’s still Wi-Fi only, but the larger screen is much nicer than the  7. I noticed when typing it is a difficult reach to some of the letters, but I have smaller hands so that may be why. I’m learning to work around it.I found a way to add Google Play to the Fire 10, and this has enhanced the entire functionality of the Fire 10. I’m not stuck using only Amazon Apps which are limited. I googled how to add Google Play to Amazon Fire 10. I think there’s info on how to add to other versions oFore Tablets also. If you follow the directions it was pretty simple. It enhanced my usage of my Fire Table tremendously.It seems to have a fast processor. This will also depend on how fast your home Wi-Fi is also.I see many improvements with the Fire 10 from my Fire 7. I can’t say for certain if this would be worth the upgrade of a more recent Fire Tablet.Overall, so far I am happy with this tablet. I haven’t had too long so I don’t know if I will find anything else the more I use it."
Price should be your focus point,4.0 out of 5 stars,"The Amazon Fire HD 10 tablet, 10.1"", 1080p Full HD, 32 GB, latest model (2021 release) in Lavender is a versatile and affordable tablet that offers impressive features and performance. Compared to the 2021 iPad basic model, the Fire HD 10 offers a similar screen size and resolution, but at a lower price point.The Fire HD 10 tablet is great for streaming, browsing the web, and basic productivity tasks, thanks to its powerful octa-core processor and 3 GB of RAM. The 10.1-inch Full HD display is vibrant and clear, making it ideal for watching videos or reading e-books. The tablet also features Alexa, Amazon's virtual assistant, which can be used to control smart home devices, answer questions, and more.One major advantage of the Fire HD 10 over the 2021 iPad basic model is the price. The Fire HD 10 retails for around $150, while the iPad basic model starts at $329. While the iPad does offer a slightly more powerful processor and access to a larger selection of apps, the Fire HD 10 provides a great value for those on a budget.In terms of storage, the Fire HD 10 comes with 32 GB of internal storage, which can be expanded up to 1 TB with a microSD card. The tablet also has a front-facing camera for video calls and a rear-facing camera for taking photos and videos.Overall, the Amazon Fire HD 10 tablet is a great option for those looking for a versatile and affordable tablet. While it may not have all the bells and whistles of the 2021 iPad basic model, it provides solid performance and features at a fraction of the price. The Lavender color also adds a nice touch of personality and style."
"Light, responsive, great resolution, easy to use",5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've used Fire 8. It's a good tablet. Nothing fanciful. Resolution was bad, 1080 etc. Anyway, I knew that when I bought the tablet. But the speed dragged too much for me to like the tablet. I only used it for streaming, games, and light online research.When Amazon had a sale on this Fire 10, I traded in my 8. I'm so glad I did.First important thing. The resolution is excellent. I think Samsung A8 tablet seems a little sharper, but I may be off. Anyhow, I am very, very happy with the display on the Fire 10. Compared to the 8, this one is royalty good. I love watching movies on this 10 tablet.Battery life so far is excellent. One charge lasts more than 10 hours and that is for streaming.The touchscreen is fantastic. I love it. Very responsive!When streaming, the volume bar also lets you mute the notifications. I did not see this feature on the Samsung Galaxy A8. That extra feature on the 10 is useful when you don't want to be disturbed.Size of the 10 is great for carrying around and for daily use. Streaming on the 10 size is more pleasant. 8 is too small for that.Like other reviewers, I wish this 10 has google playstore, especially google meet. Very disappointing that Amazon locked out google. That is a BIG MINUS for me in terms of the 10 tablet. I knew this before the purchase. I'd still keep the 10 because I like it and Amazon had offered a good trade-in value and discount on it even at the sale price.When this tablet is on sale, and especially if you can trade-in an older one, I would recommend getting the 10. It's easy to use. Even for seniors who are uncomfortable with computers.I have a bluetooth keyboard and it connected easily. Love my new 10! Thanks, Amazon. If only I had google meet on this tablet as well."
Great quality for the price,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I ordered one of these for travel in my car on long road trips with the grandkids. Mine was a ""refurbished"" option that I was quite impressed with. I was able to download some movies to play periodically on the trips and a few of the kids game for the younger grandkids. I liked the screen quality and size for viewing. I ordered another one for my 12 year old grand daughter (after liking the quality of mine) for Christmas. She previously had the kids amazon Fire which worked well when she was younger. This Fire option gives them a little more freedom and better viewing. The only drawback is the lack of ad free and the kids apps. I wish they would design an app for their Fire's that you could purchase (even yearly) to prevent the ads. They make it difficult for some of the kids to maneuver. The price was also good, I did get it with their sale."
"Beautiful large screen, relatively speedy response time, great speakers for a tablet.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"The story on this tablet is the battery doesn't have the capacity that a tablet this size should, and that's accurate. But if you know that going in, it's a wonderful tablet. 1080p screen, 10 inches, speakers are great for a tablet, and it's pretty speedy. It wasn't much trouble getting the Google Play story installed and every Play app I've installed runs just fine. I got this tablet on sale for 50% off so for $75 it was a really great deal, but I'd still have considered buying it for full price now that I've used it for a while. Just a wonderful screen and speedy enough to not be frustrating with anything. Just would have liked more storage."
Excellent amazon based tablet with some amazon centric issues,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I got this tablet after trying an apple ipad and the microsoft surface go 3.  So, I can say from my standpoint I like this fire hd 10 better than the other two tablets for a couple of different reasons.  First of all the cost is a significant difference from the Surface Go 3, and if you are not a member of the apple community the apple ipad is extremely difficult to integrate into your android based ecosystrm.The fire tablet has much similar form factor to the surface go 3.  The screen is very colorful, detailed and bright.  It is responsive and logical to get around on.  The one little issue with the tablet is it's amazon centric software and apps that are difficult to work around.  So, if you like the amazon web browser and are happy with it's email and other apps you will be very happy with it as it comes to you.  BUT, if you are one of millions who prefer Google Chrome as your browser and associated apps like gmail and google drive you will have some work to do to get those apps on this tablet.  It's not impossible but it is not for someone to do that does not have some comfort in downloading some apk files and executing them to get chrome on the tablet.  There are a couple good tutorials on the web that explain how to do this.  So, if it wasn't for this hassle to get other apps on the Fire HD 10 I would give this product a solid 5 star rating.Another very positive factor in liking this tablet is the ability to add internal storage space with an sdhc card slot.  Great!  This was another factor in my preference for this tablet over the other two.  One small issue with this tablet is the apps screen on startup.  Amazon will not let you get rid of many of the apps or even hide them if you don't want them on the tablet.  There is one small workaround to this if you don't want them cluttering up your screen and that is to put them in the ""Utility"" group on the front page.  Some of the decisions these makers of tablets make continue to amaze me with their shortsightedness and selfish behavior when it would be so much better for the customer and hence sales of the product to design it for the customer's benefit, ease of use, etc."
"Sufficient for kids who mostly surf, email, and play games, and it is priced fairly.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"I wanted a tablet that would allow my daughter to: surf the Internet, email and exchange photos with her friends, listen to music, play a few games, and enjoy learning activities.  She is also fond of watching Christian movies and watching her favorite pastors’ Sunday sermons.  The “Fire” provides those opportunities at a bargain price.  An iPad would have been an unnecessary tremendous expense.  Thus far, the “Fire” is working well for her because the controls are so intuitive.  My effort was needed to set it up, but afterwards, I just handed it over to her and she has successfully figured it all out on her own.  This tablet would be perfect for any school-aged child to use with little parental effort, except that needed to monitor safety from predators, evil websites, and the flood of spam mail.  A little encouragement to only share her email address with family members and a small, trusted group of friends seems to have limited spam mail to some extent.  If she doesn’t immediately recognize the sender, she deletes it without opening it.  This tablet has been a good device for us all.  A protective case of some sort to protect the screen is a wise precaution, and my daughter enjoyed picking it out."
Traded a basic Kindle for this one.  It's kind of amazing.,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I had a nice Kindle that allowed me to read in black and white.  It was very useful.  I could read in bed without turning on a light.  You can carry lots of books on the thin, light pad.  You can adjust the size of the type to fit your vision.  Pretty good.  I traded that one for the Amazon Fire HD 10 inch tablet.  I'm not sure what all it will do.  It does a lot.  You can watch movies.  It takes photographs.  Of course, you can still load books from the library or wherever you get your books.  The screen is full, vivid color and you can listen to music.  You can get more apps.  It will take me a long time to figure out what it will do, but it's amazing.And you can still read books with it."
Good for what it is.,4.0 out of 5 stars,"This is great for the purpose intended. It's not a full blown android tablet, so if that's what your looking for, better go get one of those. For doing Amazon related stuff and surfing the internet, all while feeding you Amazon marketing, it's great. I've had half a dozen over the years and for the money, they're great. They do slow down alot after a year or two, but if you wait till Christmas time, you can replace with a new model for about half the retail price. If your kids need a tablet and your hesitant to give them a several hundred dollar device, this is the ticket. It even plays games, only Amazon store games, but there's a decent selection. So, there's my opinion on them. I'll probably get another one next year to replace the one of the fire 8s that are still running strong but slow. The 10s are great. Hopefully a new model will come along soon."
